## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to study how different sampling techniques affect the performance of machine learning models when working with an imbalanced dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset contains credit card transaction data with a highly imbalanced target variable, where fraudulent transactions are very rare.

## Sampling Techniques Used
- Random Under Sampling
- Random Over Sampling
- SMOTE
- NearMiss
- SMOTE with Tomek Links

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN
- SVM

## Conclusion
The results show that the performance of a model depends on the sampling technique used. Therefore, selecting an appropriate sampling method is important when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
